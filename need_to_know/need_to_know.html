            <p class="text-center">Pepe, the brave Mexican hero from San Miguel, proudly wears his poncho and faces the
                wild chickens.
                They attack him, but Pepe deftly jumps on them and defeats one rooster after another.
                But the crazy chicken Coco is persistent. Pepe throws hot sauce bottles, but Coco narrowly escapes.
                As the sun slowly sets, Pepe stands there panting and looks resolutely at Coco.
                Destiny hangs in the air and the village of San Miguel hopes for Pepe's victory. The question remains
                open:
                Will Pepe finally defeat Coco and save the village?</p>

            <p class="text-center">The chickens are small and inconspicuous,
                but don't underestimate their abilities. They are equipped with chicks that can jump amazingly high.
                The chicks follow the hens closely as they swarm around in wild confusion.
                The chickens themselves may not look strong, but their attacks are fast and incessant.
                They try to circle Pepe and attack from afar. But Pepe is not easy to defeat.</p>

                With its impressive size, it towers head and shoulders above all other chickens.
                Her imposing physique is covered in muscular feathers that give her an imposing appearance.
                Loca's presence is almost menacing as she stands with spread wings and flaunts her imposing body weight.
                This impressive stature gives her a dominant air that makes her even more difficult to subdue.
